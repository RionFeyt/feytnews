    Generate a detailed {timeframe} forecast based on current global trends.
    Use the tone: {tone}.
    The forecast must include clear sections with bold titles for:
    - Economy
    - Job Market
    - Consumer Behavior
    - Technology
    - Environment
    - Geopolitics
    - Health/Public Safety

    After each section, provide 2-3 bullet-point predictions specific to that area. Have sections showing assumptions and reasoning for these assumptions.
    At the end of the report, summarize whether sentiment trends toward a positive or negative future using visual cues (e.g., ðŸ“ˆ or ðŸ“‰).
    Include a final paragraph predicting the next month, and another for the next year.
    Ensure the report is at least 1000 words.
    Format it with HTML tags (like <h4>, <ul>, <li>, <p>) to structure the response.
